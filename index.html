                    <h2><strong>Ten Days, Six Dates</h2>
                    <p>First date, Skirted Heifer for burgers and fries,<br>
                    Immediate connection and sexual attraction, no lie.</p>
                    <p>Second date you started reading my mind, <br>
                    Your dinner was the same as mine.<br>
                    That's when I showed you my crazy,<br>
                    Yet, still, you wanted to call me baby!
                    </p>
                    <p>Third date was a beer and a dainty gin drink,<br>
                    First kiss, oh my! What did you think?<br>
                    Your touches gave me tingles, your kisses made me wet,<br>
                    But wait, no sex just yet!</p>
                    <p>Fourth date was the Best. Date. Ever.<br>
                    I wanted it to end, never.<br>
                    Dressed up at a dive bar drinking Long Island Iced Teas,<br>
                    Your hands all over me, I wanted time to freeze.</p>
                    <p>Fifth date was Ted's Montana Grill,<br>
                    Next, the bar where you gave me a thrill.<br>
                    It was hard to keep you at bay,<br>
                    Through your pants I could tell what you'd say.</p>
                    <p>Date six we went out for sushi,<br>
                    Then back at your place for a make-out seshie.</p>
                    <p>Anniversary one meant matching swimsuits and shoes,<br>
                    Near year two, matching Vegas adventure tattoos.</p>
                    <p>I survived 9 months without you near,<br>
                    Now the future without you I fear.<br>
                    I want to be yours and you to be mine,<br>
                    But winning you back I know will take time.<strong></p>
